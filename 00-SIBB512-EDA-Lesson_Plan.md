# SIBC512 - Biochemistry Laboratory

## Topic: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Learning Objectives

- Can explain the purpose of exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Can explain and interpret basic graphs, such as, a histogram, a boxplot, a scatter plot
- Can explain basic statistical measures, such as mean, meadian, standard deviation, standard error, standard error of mean (SEM), confidence interval

## Content

In this class, students will be introduced to the basic concept of exploratory data analysis. Basic statistical measurements will be reviewed together with the common graphs. Hands-on practical lab will be taught using R statistical language as a tool to demonstrate common tasks perform in EDA and basic data visualization.
